This project demonstrates the development of a **Generative AI-based chatbot** using **Python**, **Rasa**, and **HuggingFace Transformers**. The chatbot is capable of handling user queries in a context-aware manner using a combination of rule-based and generative AI models. It aims to improve customer engagement by providing natural, dynamic, and intelligent conversations without relying on hard-coded scripts.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a chatbot that understands user intents and entities using **Rasa NLU**.
- Integrate a **Generative AI model** (e.g., GPT-2) to handle open-ended or unknown queries.
- Deploy the chatbot through a basic **HTML-based web interface**.
- Enable feedback and learning mechanisms for future scalability and improvement.
